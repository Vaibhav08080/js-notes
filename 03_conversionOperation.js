let score = 33
typeof(score )
// when we are getting the value from the frontend we can use the typeof operator in order to find the type of value sometimes we are not fcking sure about the typeof values coming form the form therefore we can use that there
let ValueInNumber= Number(score) // by ths line we are converting the value of the score in number in order to remove the error for the stupid niggers
// if some nigga type 33abc some wierd ass shit because he has no life then is we have to convert that number in the NUmber data strurcture but whwn we want to check its value its NaN ( Not a Number ) therefore we have to use type script over this stuoopid niggas language null is converted in 0 and undefined is converted into NaN
// in boolean empty str is converted into false and some weird ass shit is converted in true 
 let value =3 
 let negvalue = -value
 // this negvalue will convert into negative value
