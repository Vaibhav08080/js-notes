// data types are divided into two parts primitive and non primitive 
// primitive string number boolean null undefined symbol bigint

// reference or non primitive array objects functions
// JavaScript is a dynamically typed language.

// noe if you change the value of the niggji still the value of the objectnigga will be changed bcz it is non primitive data type
